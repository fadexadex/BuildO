ok so add it as well that the rank and xp progress should be better calculated to match the available levels so it makes sense, leaderboard and trophies can be taken out for now since we aren't really using them, the nav should better focus the most important things. the ui for connect ui seems sort of wierd, it is not very clear that there is a demo wallet there, the demo controls are not quite smooth and there yet ( the demo can better simulate the choices that could be taken across the levels with more levels of details, after the challenge, we should be able to take the user in the next step in the journey so they are not left alone and actually have the resources to keep learning and improving(come up with an idea for this) 

these are the things in the judging criteria, the project is for an hackathon, so we need to give the users that are interested in the playground value and this sense of enjoyment, we could transition into a more gamified experience where the learners are much more involved in the playground and can utilize all their senses to actually, learn about the world. you can break the plans into phases so they can be gradually implemented in the best possible way, there could be connections to different chapters but I need it to be really valuable, useful and extremely helpful to people who are new to the eco system of zk proofs



Judging Criteria

Innovation - 10%

Guiding Points:

    Does the team’s project align to the hackathon track?

    Does this extend, or establish new, capabilities for the Hedera ecosystem?


Feasibility - 10%

Guiding Points:

    Can the proposed idea be created using Hedera network services or ecosystem platforms?
    Does this need to be a Web3 solution? Or could it be done already on Web2?
    Does the team understand the problem space / domain that they’re solving?
    Does the team understand what’s required to execute the solution, and have the capability to do so?
    Did the team create, and understand, a Lean / Business Model Canvas to illustrate the business model intended to be used as part of the solution being created?


Execution - 20%

Guiding Points:

    Were the team able to create a MVP for their solution?
    Did the team deliver a Proof of Concept (PoC) with a limited, but important, set of features?
    Did the team create a fully functioning solution?
    Did the team function well together and work to each other’s strengths? Was there effective leadership within the team?
    Did the team establish a strategy and long-term plan for the development of the solution beyond the hackathon?
    Did the team identify a Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy for the solution?
    Did the team identify where they could use market feedback cycles to improve the solution / idea?
    Did the team identify important design decisions they made?
    Did the team have a good emphasis on user experience/accessibility?


Integration - 15%

Guiding Points:

    To what degree does the project use the Hedera network?
    How integrated is it? What services are used?
    Are any of our ecosystem platforms being used, or leveraged?
    Is a Hedera service being integrated in a way it hasn’t been seen before? (creativity)


Success - 20%

Guiding Points:

    Does the solution positively impact the Hedera network or ecosystem?
    Does the solution lead to more Hedera accounts being created?
    Does the solution give rise to a high number of monthly active Hedera accounts?
    Does the solution lead to greater TPS on the Hedera network?
    Does the solution give the Hedera network exposure to a greater audience?


Validation - 15%

Guiding Points:

    Did the team identify where to gain market feedback? e.g. ask users / customers, partners, practitioners, subject matter experts (SMEs) etc.
    Did the team establish one or more market feedback cycles? e.g. Following up with users that tried the product to ask for feedback, or a review?
    What traction with the market have the team achieved?
    Onboarded early adopters | Free / Paid trials? | Taken any revenue? | What is the market sentiment? | What is the growth / churn rate?


Pitch - 10%

Guiding Points:

    Are the problem and solution presented clearly?
    Is the problem big enough for sustained growth?
    Is the style and narrative of the pitch well thought out & executed?
    Were the team able to convey a significant & exciting opportunity?
    Did the number / metrics of the solution make sense?
    How was Hedera represented in the pitch?
    Were suitable responses to questions given?
    Do they clearly state their MVP’s features & why they chose those / them?
